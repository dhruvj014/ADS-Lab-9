Stellar Classification Model This repository contains a stellar classification model that uses various classification methods to achieve high accuracy. The model is deployed using Streamlit, so it can be easily accessed and used by anyone with a web browser. Classification Methods The model uses the classification method of : â€¢ Random forests: Random forests are an ensemble learning method that works by training multiple decision trees on different subsets of the training data and then predicting the class of a new data point based on the predictions of the individual decision trees. Model Accuracy The model achieves a high accuracy of over 99% on the benchmark Hipparcos stellar dataset. Deployment The model is deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web apps. The Streamlit app allows users to upload an image of a star and the model will predict the star's type. Usage To use the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Install the required dependencies: pip install streamlit
    Start the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5501. Conclusion This stellar classification model is a powerful tool that can be used to identify and classify stars with high accuracy. The model is easy to use and deploy, making it a valuable resource for astronomers and anyone else interested in stellar classification.
